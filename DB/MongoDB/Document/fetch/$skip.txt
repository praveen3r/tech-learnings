{ $skip: <positive integer> }

-----------------------------------------

Skips over the specified number of documents that pass into the stage and passes the remaining 
documents to the next stage in the pipeline.

Example
---------

db.article.aggregate([
    { $skip : 5 }
]);

This operation returns only the first 5 documents passed to it by the pipeline. 
$limit has no effect on the content of the documents it passes.
