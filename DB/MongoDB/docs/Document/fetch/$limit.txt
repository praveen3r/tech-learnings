$limit (aggregation)

-----------------------------------------

{ $limit: <positive integer> }

Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage in the pipeline.
$limit takes a positive integer that specifies the maximum number of documents to pass along.

Example
---------

db.article.aggregate([
   { $limit : 5 }
]);

This operation returns only the first 5 documents passed to it by the pipeline. 
$limit has no effect on the content of the documents it passes.

$sort and Memory Restrictions
-------------------------------

The $sort stage has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM. By default, if the stage exceeds this 
limit, $sort will produce an error. To allow for the handling of large datasets, set the 
allowDiskUse option to true to enable $sort operations to write to temporary files. See the 
allowDiskUse option in db.collection.aggregate() method and the aggregate command for details.
