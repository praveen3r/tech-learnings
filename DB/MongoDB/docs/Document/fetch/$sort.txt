$sort (aggregation)

-----------------------------------------

Ascending/Descending Sort
---------------------------

For the field or fields to sort by, set the sort order to 1 or -1 to specify an 
ascending or descending sort respectively, as in the following example:

db.users.aggregate(
   [
     { $sort : { age : -1, posts: 1 } }
   ]
)

$sort and Memory Restrictions
-------------------------------

The $sort stage has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM. By default, if the stage exceeds this 
limit, $sort will produce an error. To allow for the handling of large datasets, set the 
allowDiskUse option to true to enable $sort operations to write to temporary files. See the 
allowDiskUse option in db.collection.aggregate() method and the aggregate command for details.
