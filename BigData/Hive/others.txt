2. Rename Table in Hive
To rename an existing table in Hive, use the ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO command.

Syntax:
ALTER TABLE old_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Create Table As (CTAS) in Hive
The CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement creates a new table from an existing table with the results of a query.

Syntax:

CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM existing_table
WHERE condition;

Example:

CREATE TABLE high_salary_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
ðŸ”¹ This creates a new table high_salary_employees with employees earning more than 50,000.

Key Notes About CTAS:
The new table is created as a managed table (unless an external location is specified).
The new table does not inherit constraints, partitions, or primary keys from the original table.
CTAS cannot be used with partitioned tables directly. Instead, use INSERT INTO after creating a partitioned table.
