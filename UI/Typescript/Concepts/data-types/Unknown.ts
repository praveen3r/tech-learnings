/*
TypeScript 3.0 introduces a new top type unknown. unknown is the type-safe counterpart of any. 
Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isnâ€™t assignable to anything but itself and any 
without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Likewise, no operations are permitted 
on an unknown without first asserting or narrowing to a more specific type.

userInput = 5;
userInput = 'Max';
